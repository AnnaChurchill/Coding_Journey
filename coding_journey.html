                    The first time I came across coding was at a STEM camp I attended in year 10. We had a little board with some coloured lights and we made the flash in different patterns by writing code for them. I found it very enjoyable, but didn't think much of it until I started to apply for university courses. I had always known I wanted to study maths, but a second major was something I had no idea about. Thinking about that small amount of coding I had enjoyed in year 10, I decided to give coputer science a go.

                    I was very nervous about enrolling in computer science as I really had no experience in code and wondered if all my peers would have learnt some at school. So, before the first semester started, I decided to learn a bit of python myself on Sololearn. It turned out that that put me quite ahead of the beginning coursework, and I was able to get on top of all the information. I ended up really loving python and doing very well in it.

                    The next semester I learnt object oriented programming using java, which I also did well in.

                    The third language we took on was C in "Systems Programming". I found this to be a very challenging language and course, especially with the changes that covid brought to learning at university. I certainly struggled in this subject at the beginning. I did not pass the first time but as I reviewed and applied myself more to the learning I eventually got a good grasp of C. Even though I at first struggled with it, C is a langauge I really love working in and I hope to continue working with it in the future. It is a challenge but it is great as a programmer to be able to control memory allocation and get a greater view and control of what is happening in memory with each line of code.

                Alongside those three main languages I studied (Python, Java and C), I also came across and gained experience in:
                <ul>
                    <li>R</li>
                    <li>Bash Script</li>
                    <li>Matlab</li>

                </ul>

                As well as these languages, I learned a series of further skills which broaden my abilities into data science. These include using python's Matplotlib package and creating excel spreadsheet formulas to analyse data.

                At university I also studied non-language based computer science subjects that I absolutley loved. My favourite were "Models of Computation", "Algorithm Design" and "Algebra and Logic". These sparked both my love of logical problem solving and challenged my creativity. Creating algorithms to solve problems is something I love and discovering different ways at looking at logical patterns and callenges was such a valuable and exciting part of my university education. I would love to continue my learning in these areas.

                    Now that I have completed my university course, I continue to expand my repertoire of languages and skills. Although my greatest passion lies in algorithms and problem solving, I have begun to learn some front end skills that I could use in my own projects, or could be a path for future employment. I have just completed a course in HTML on Sololearn and am most of the way to completing a CSS course to compliment it. I am thoroughly enjoying learning these skills and finding purposes for their application. I plan on next completing a Javascript course (on Sololearn as well) to help me create websites with which you can interact.

                While completing these course I have been making short notes to use in future when building websites. These notes can be found in my Coding Journey folder on my github page

                I have a few projects that I am currently working on for my own development and enjoyment. This coding journey blog is one of those projects. The others can be found in my github repositories. My projects at present are:
                <ul>
                    <li>An algorithm designed for a person playing Cluedo to help them store and use more information than they otherwise could using pen and paper. This is to aid the player in winning. This is for my own enjoyment and I hope to use the algorithm to compete in Cluedo with a friend who is also taking on the same challenge. I am writing my algorithm in C as a challenge to myself and in hope that it leads me to improve in the language and my logical thinking skills.</li>
                    <li>A blog following the trip I am taking around Australia in 2023. For this I will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript. In this I hope to achieve an interactive blog that I can easily update, and has many features including images available for download, oportunity for others to leave comments, and possibly a map with animation. I am attempting this in order to record my trip, as well as greatly develop my skills in all three languages.</li>
