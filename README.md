# Coding_Journey
My first blog detailing my coding journey

This will start as a website of information only, made in html and css. At the time of starting this blog I am still learning CSS. This blog will be updated by directly updating the html and css.

In future I may try to implement a more user friendly way of updating it via the webpage but for now the purpose is practise in html and css.
